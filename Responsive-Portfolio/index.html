			<p class="para">I was born on May 15, 1991 in Newmarket, ON, Canada. I have immediate family in both Canada and the United States which explains how I ended up in Austin.</p>
			<p class="para">After graduting from college in Canada with a degree in Political Studies, the lack of serious job opportunities in my area/field led me to the decision to try my luck in Texas.</p>
			<p class="para">Making the move down wasn't easy at first. Apart from my mother and stepfather I had zero connections or friends in the Austin area. Initially the going was tough. Countless resumes and cover letters were met with deafeninig silence. After months of futile effort I had resigned myself to playing countless hours of Rome: Total War and Hearts of Iron when I finally decided to bite the bullet and get a minimum wage retail job. Something, ANYTHING, to keep me busy and my morale up.</p>
			<p class="para">Eventually I was able to land a job with the state which allowed me to move into the city.</p>
